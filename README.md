# Object Detection and Tracking in Videos
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<b>Data Collection:</b> Gather a dataset of videos containing the objects you want to detect and track.<br> Download yolov3.wiights file from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam316/yolov3-weights">here</a>.<br>
<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Extract video frames and annotate them with bounding boxes around objects. <br>
<b>Model Selection:</b> Choose an object detection model like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN. <br>
<b>Model Training:</b> Train the chosen model on the annotated frames to recognize objects. <br>
<b>Real-time Detection:</b> Implement the model to detect objects in real-time video streams. <br>
<b>Object Tracking:</b> Use techniques like Kalman filters or optical flow to track detected objects across frames. <br>
<b>Visualization:</b> Visualize the detected and tracked objects in the video. <br>
<h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
Python <br>
Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch) <br>
Computer vision libraries (OpenCV) <br>
